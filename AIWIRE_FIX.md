# 🤖 AIWire RSS Feed Issue - Fixed!

## 🚨 Problem

The AIWire RSS feeds (15 feeds) were not loading properly, causing errors during RSS fetching operations. These feeds were included in the default database initialization but were failing to load.

## 🔧 Solutions Provided

### 1. **Remove AIWire Feeds (Recommended)**

Remove all AIWire feeds from your existing database:

```bash
npm run remove:aiwire
```

This will:
- Remove all 15 AIWire RSS feeds from the database
- Show you the remaining working feeds
- Display a count of remaining feeds

### 2. **Test All RSS Feeds**

Test all your RSS feeds to see which ones are working:

```bash
npm run test:rss
```

This will:
- Test every RSS feed in your database
- Show which feeds are working and which are failing
- Provide detailed error messages for failed feeds
- Give you a success rate percentage
- Specifically highlight AIWire feeds

### 3. **Prevent Future AIWire Issues**

The database initialization has been updated to **not include AIWire feeds by default**. New installations won't have this problem.

## 📊 What Was Fixed

### **Before:**
- 15 AIWire feeds were automatically added to new databases
- All AIWire feeds were failing to load
- RSS fetching operations would fail or timeout

### **After:**
- AIWire feeds are commented out in database initialization
- Easy removal script for existing installations
- Comprehensive testing script to identify problematic feeds
- Clean, working RSS feed setup

## 🛠️ Commands Available

```bash
# Remove AIWire feeds from existing database
npm run remove:aiwire

# Test all RSS feeds to see which work
npm run test:rss

# List all RSS feeds
npm run rss:list

# Add a new RSS feed manually
npm run rss:add "Feed Name" "https://feed-url.com/rss"

# Remove a specific feed by ID
