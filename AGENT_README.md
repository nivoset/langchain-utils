## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Model Configuration

The agent uses Ollama models. You can configure:

```bash
# In your .env file
OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.2          # Main model for responses
OLLAMA_EMBEDDING_MODEL=nomic-embed-text  # Model for embeddings
OLLAMA_BASE_URL=http://localhost:11434   # Ollama server URL
```

### Performance Tuning

Adjust these parameters for better performance:

- **Documents**: More documents = more context but slower processing
- **Threshold**: Higher threshold = more relevant but fewer results
- **Model**: Different models have different speed/quality trade-offs

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Programmatic Usage

```typescript
import { AgentService } from './src/services/agent.service.js';

const agentService = new AgentService();
await agentService.initialize();

// Ask a question
const response = await agentService.askQuestion(
  "What are the latest developments in AI?",
  8,    // max documents
  0.7   // similarity threshold
);

console.log(response.answer);
console.log(response.sources);
```

### Custom Prompts

The agent uses carefully crafted prompts for different types of queries:

- **General Questions**: Balanced for comprehensive answers
- **Company Questions**: Focused on specific company information
- **Sentiment Summaries**: Optimized for trend analysis

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No relevant articles found"**
   - Ensure your vector store has articles: `npm run vectorstore:add`
   - Try lowering the similarity threshold
   - Rephrase your question
   - **NEW**: The agent now provides debug information when no results pass the threshold, showing:
     - Number of articles found
     - Median similarity score
     - Top similarity score
     - Suggested threshold adjustment

2. **"Ollama connection failed"**
   - Check if Ollama is running: `ollama list`
   - Verify OLLAMA_BASE_URL in your .env file
   - Ensure the model is downloaded: `ollama pull llama3.2`

3. **"Slow response times"**
   - Reduce the number of documents retrieved
   - Use a faster model
   - Increase similarity threshold

### Performance Tips

- Use specific questions for better results
- Start with lower document counts for faster responses
- Use company-specific queries for targeted information
- Monitor processing times to optimize parameters

### Debug Information

When no results pass the similarity threshold, the agent provides detailed debug information:

```bash
$ npm run agent:ask "What are the latest developments in quantum computing?" --threshold 0.8

I found 12 articles, but none met the similarity threshold of 0.8.

Debug Info:
- Articles found: 12
- Median similarity: 0.234
- Top similarity: 0.456
- Threshold: 0.8

Try lowering the threshold (e.g., --threshold 0.6) or rephrasing your question.
```

This helps you understand:
- How many articles were found
- The distribution of similarity scores
- Whether to adjust the threshold or rephrase the question

## üìà Monitoring

The agent provides detailed metadata for monitoring:

- **Processing Time**: How long each query takes
- **Documents Retrieved**: Number of articles used
- **Relevance Scores**: How relevant each source is
- **Source Attribution**: Full article details

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

Planned features:
- Multi-language support
- Custom prompt templates
- Batch question processing
- Export capabilities
- Web interface
- Real-time news integration
